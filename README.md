# Mortgage Loan Approval System
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
The individual project focuses on enhancing the mortgage loan approval project based on the workshops provided in this course. It looks at improving the process of home loan approvals by removing the need for human intervention to decide if an application is suitable for approval. This is achieved by utilizing the rules engine in JBPM to define the criteria and appropriate decisions to be made.
